This folder is being set up to allow people to test pushing changes to a GitHub repository.

Your mission, which I'm asking you to take on, is to:

1. set up the repo in GitHub Desktop
2. pull to ensure that things are up to date on your end
3. create a text file in RStudio called "LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME.md" where you use your name.
4. Add your answer to the following prompt in that file: "What is the most surprising thing that you've learned so far in this class?"
5. Add your file to the repo, commit your changes (including the URL "https://github.com/STAT210-S23/Parsons_Paper_Register/issues/13" in your commit message), pull again (for good measure!), then push your changes.
6. Add the link to your commit to the https://github.com/STAT210-S23/Parsons_Paper_Register/issues/13 issue and give it a thumbs up.
