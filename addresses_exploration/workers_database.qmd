## Workers' Summary

Tasked with finding information about employees at a paper mill, we used the database ancestry.com.

The link to Amherst's access to ancestry website is [here](https://libguides.amherst.edu/c.php?g=944984&p=6812570).

Here is how the ancestry website looks at a first glance:

By searching for a name and a place, (Holyoke, Hampden, Massachusetts), we were able to find census information from the 1800s and track down paper mill workers.

The number of names that appear in first search. We used educated guess to selected the most appropriate person.

The names we used were in a registry from 1863.

The amount of information we could find on each worker varied from name to name but in general, we were able to find birth year, birthplace, spouse, children, parents, occupation, and address. We then compiled these results into a spreadsheet. 

Lucy Allen was one of the names in the record book.

She was born in Massachusetts in 1842 and lived in dwelling 42.

We were unable to find the house number or the street name but we did find that Lucy had a sister named Eliza Ann born in 1841.

Their father's name was Job Allen and their mother was Anna Allen.

Job was born in England and moved to the United States sometime before 1841.

The interesting thing about the Allen family is that Eliza Ann, Lucy, and Job all worked at the Parsons Paper Company.

Anna Allen stayed at home.

This was an unfortunate but somewhat common life for a working-class family in Holyoke, Massachusetts in the 1860s.

Conversely, we were able to find records on Joseph C. Parsons; the founder of the Parsons Paper Company.

!\[Joseph Clark\] (Joseph_Clark.jpeg)

Born on February 6, 1814, in Northhampton, Hampshire County, Massachusetts to Lydia and Justice Parsons, Joseph Clark Parsons was a local businessman who became very successful after founding his mill.

He married Lucretia Hoyt Parsons and had three daughters; Catherine Turner Taft, Fannie Colton Parsons, and Elizabeth Hoyt Parsons.

We found that Parsons lived in house 22 of dwelling 165 on Suffolk street which was quite close to his Mill.

This was surprising because we expected him to live in the upper-class district because wealthier people lived in hills above sea level. 

## Database

This is the aggregated info for some of the workers who worked in Parsons' paper in the 1860s:
