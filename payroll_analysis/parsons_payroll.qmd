## Introduction

The Parsons Paper Register contains over 300 pages of employee and payroll records from January 1861 to April 1869 from Parsons Paper Company in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Founded in 1853 by Joseph Parsons, Parsons Paper Company was the oldest and largest manufacturer of cotton-based high quality writing papers in Holyoke. The original pages of the register were scanned and screenshots are included in the analysis below. Pages contain information such as employee name and signature, role, days worked, and total wages earned, and are organized by separate pay periods.

The goal of this report is to explore patterns in employment and different groups of employees over time by analyzing the payroll records in the 1861-1869 time period, both before and after the end of the Civil War. First, we aimed to quantify the length of a single pay period as well as the number of employees working at Parsons Paper Company during the era spanning the register. The 1860s were a time of great growth for the company, and by the beginning of the Civil War in 1861 Parsons Paper Company had already become the largest manufacturer of writing and envelope paper in the United States. We then examined the distribution of different roles within the company, ranging from women who worked in the "rag room" where the raw material for paper was cut and processed, to men who worked in the engine room and repairs. We hope that this report can provide some insight into the different day-to-day operations at Parsons Paper Company, as well as the individuals who worked there, many of whom stayed for several years.Â

Everts writes that

"The buildings of this company are situated on the river-bank near the dam, and were built in 1853. They are two in number,\--the **main mill**, where the paper is made, and what is known as the **finishing-mill**, where it is finished. The former is a structure three stories and a basement high. The upper floor and attic are devoted to **drying** purposes, while the second story contains the **storehouse** and **rag-rooms**. About 175 persons are employed on the two floors. On the ground-floor is the **engine-room**, which contains sixteen 450-pound and fourteen 250-pound engines. The mill has three Fourdrinier machines...The finishing-mill is also situated on the bank of the river, a short distance from the other mill, and, like that, is a brick structure three stories high. The attic and third floor are used for **packing**, and on the second floor the paper is **reeled** and **jogged**. On the first floor are eight 6-roll calendars and three powerful hydraulic presses, and in the basement is a box-factory and plating-machines" (919).

From Burt's Illustrated Guide of the Connecticut Valley ([page 79](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AAB2140.0001.001/83)), we also know that at the end of 1867, the Parsons Paper Co. employed 150 people and had "nineteen engines for grinding rags," turning out "800 tons of paper yearly."

## How many days in a pay period?

-   The Parsons Paper Company register available from the Holyoke (Massachusetts) Public Library History Room comprises monthly pay periods from January 1861-April 1869

-   Pay periods appear to be a month long with employees typically getting paid on the 1st of the next (?) month

-   Based off the spreadsheet from p. 253, most employees work between 20-30 days each pay period, the average is around 27 so most employees work at least 6 days/week

    -   In Chapter IV of Green's book, she writes that male Holyoke paper makers worked 58-72 hours a week

        -   11.25 hours five days a week + 8.75 hours on Saturday was typical for Holyoke textile mills

    -   Women worked slightly shorter hours

-   Pgs. 261-263 appear to comprise an entire pay period for the month of April in 1868 (most pay periods span \~3 pages in the register)

    ![p. 261](images/Screenshot%202023-02-13%20at%204.08.16%20PM.png){width="220"}![](images/Screenshot%202023-02-13%20at%204.08.28%20PM.png){width="220"}![](images/Screenshot%202023-02-13%20at%204.08.37%20PM.png){width="220"}

-   Pgs. 223-225 below and Pgs. 261-263 above are exactly one year apart in the register (April 1st 1867 + April 1st 1868)

    ![](images/Screenshot%202023-02-13%20at%204.14.02%20PM.png){width="220"}![](images/Screenshot%202023-02-13%20at%204.14.09%20PM-01.png){width="220"}![](images/Screenshot%202023-02-13%20at%204.14.16%20PM.png){width="220"}

## How many employees during this era?

-   Counted 92 employees in April 1861, 122 employees in April 1862, 141 employees in April 1863, 128 employees in April 1864, 159 employees in April 1865, 144 employees in April 1866, 131 employees in April 1867, 153 employees in April 1868, 153 employees in April 1869

    -   Average across the measured 9 years = 136 employees between 1861-1869

        -   Subset Pages: 8-10 (1861) 43-45 (1862), 79-81 (1863), 115-117 (1864 - this month also has pay records from the 30th not included in the employee count above), 151-153 (1865), 187-189 (1866) 223-225 (1867), 261-263 (1868), 314-316 (1869)

    -   Number of employees generally increased over time

        -   Green mentions that these mills had abnormally high employee retention rates
        -   Boom in employment towards end of Civil War in 1865

-   Some pages have a separate section of employees at the bottom under "Repairs" and "Repairs & Watchmen" (April 1862 p.45 - 4 employees under 'Repairs & Watchmen') \-- I included these names in the counts above

    ![](images/Screenshot%202023-02-13%20at%204.18.46%20PM.png){width="404"}

    -   Presumably employees whose main role was to repair the machines instead of making paper

    -   There were 5 people under "Repairs" for April 1st, 1867 (see p. 225 above) and 8 under April 1st, 1868 (see p. 262 above)

## Spreadsheet tracking employment by job type for first 6 months of the register (Jan-Jun 1861)

[Spreadsheet LINK](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dza87xBB2pgVajOuLYBM_fHfAobr6IFIZFAu4vFOnhs/edit?usp=sharing)

```{r}
employment <- read.csv("parsons_jobs.csv")

kable(employment)
```

-   Role labels become very sporadic after first year

    -   'Repairs' and 'Repairs and Watchmen', however, remain in their own section at the bottom

        -   All males

-   The sorters, stampers, sealers, count&folders, rag room/cutter roles remain throughout 1861-1869, although there are much fewer of them compared to the unlabeled names

    -   These roles were held by almost all women

**Quotes from Hickey thesis that may be of relevance to employment from 1861-1869**

-   "In 1861, after a period of severe readjustment just prior to the Civil War, twenty-one of the thirty-six manufactures of fine papers met at Pittsfield...to organize a protrective association. They desired to raise prices which had fallen drastically as the result of a decrease in demand. They agreed to reduce output by about one-third for about three months. This was the first trade association established in the paper industry of the United States....The Parsons Paper Company and the Carew Manufacturing Company were charter members of this organization" (108)

-   "Since the discovery of how to utilize wood for the manufacture of paper in 1867, this raw material has been in increasing demand" (84)

-   "several of the local mills were quite large, employing 200 or more workers" and there were "about 3700 workers employed in the local paper industry at the turn of the century" (4)

-   "Repairs, if necessary, are undertaken on Sundays" (94)

-   "In replacing a wire on a Fourdrinier paper machine, workers in the Holyoke mills receive half a day's pay besides their regular pay during the hours they work on the replacement. This acts as an incentive to the workers to get the machine back in operation as soon as possible" (94)
